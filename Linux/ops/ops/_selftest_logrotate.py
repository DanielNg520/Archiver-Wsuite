ops._selftest_logrotate
───────────────────────
Proves the copytruncate rotation contract:
  - under-threshold logs are untouched
  - an oversized log is gzipped to a timestamped generation and truncated
    IN PLACE (same inode — launchd's O_APPEND descriptor must stay valid)
  - generations beyond `keep` are pruned, oldest first
  - a non-.log file is never touched

Run:  python3 -m ops._selftest_logrotate
Style matches core's _selftest scripts: plain asserts, checkmark per
assertion, nonzero exit on first failure. Temp dir only.
