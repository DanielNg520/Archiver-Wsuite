core.heartbeat
──────────────
The cross-process status-file primitive. Several workers publish a tiny JSON
"I'm alive and here's what I'm doing" file that another process reads for a
status line — the dispatcher's upload progress, the archiver loop's phase. They
all want the SAME three guarantees, which used to be copy-pasted into each
writer AND each reader (dispatcher.progress, archiver.loop_state, and ops' own
copies):

  1. ATOMIC write   — tmp + os.replace, so a reader sees the old file or the new
                      one, never a half-written one.
  2. LIVENESS gate  — a read returns None if the writer pid is gone, so a
                      crashed worker can never leave a lying status behind.
  3. STALENESS gate — optionally, a read returns None if the heartbeat is older
                      than a deadline (a writer that's wedged but not dead).

Centralizing them means a fix to the liveness/atomicity logic lands everywhere
at once instead of in one of five places. Each caller still owns its own
payload shape (and any domain validation) via the `validate` predicate.

CONTRACT: never raises for an I/O problem — a status file must never break the
work it describes. A write failure is swallowed; a read failure returns None.
