"""Process-level singleton lock for the Telegram session owner.

A thin specialization of core.InstanceLock: the flock mechanism, holder-pid
probe, and stale-free crash safety all live in core (one implementation for
every worker). This subclass only contributes what's dispatcher-specific —
the lock path is keyed to the Telegram SESSION (its singleton-ness is per
session, not per worker name) and the "already running" message points the
operator at launchd.

    The kernel releases the lock automatically when the holder exits or crashes,

    path regardless of CWD — a bare session name is anchored to a fixed config
    dir, and a session name that is itself a path keeps the lock beside the
    session file (equally absolute). A CWD-relative path would let a
    launchd-started dispatcher (CWD /) and a manual one (CWD ~) each lock a
    different file and both run — the exact failure this guard prevents.
