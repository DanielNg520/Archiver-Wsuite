"""
dispatcher.drain
────────────────
The drain loop, now reading/writing the ONE shared table via core.ItemStore.
No QueueDB, no second database, no reconcile bridge.

TEMPLATE METHOD: claim → send → finalize → cleanup. Each is one call.

CLAIM-THEN-SEND: we flip pending→sending before the send. A crash mid-send
leaves the row 'sending'; the startup watchdog (reset_stuck_sending) reverts
it to pending and we re-send. The only duplicate window is a crash between
send-success and mark_sent — unavoidable without Telegram idempotency keys,
and now at least auditable via tg_message_id once recorded.

CAPTION: items may carry a producer-set caption. If absent, the dispatcher
formats a default — caption is a presentation concern of the sender, so it
lives here, not duplicated into every producer.

# Producers whose videos are already run through media_prep.prepare() at INGEST

# streamable net is the backstop for producers that DON'T prep — chiefly the
# recorder, whose remux is fail-soft. So for these sources a non-streamable file
# reaching the queue is intentional (e.g. an .mkv kept as a full-quality document
# beside its .mp4 preview) and must ship as-is, not be re-converted at send.

# How often the drain loop re-runs its housekeeping: the failed-queue
# maintenance chain (drop missing-file tombstones → retention GC → auto-retry
# the survivors) and the stuck-'sending' watchdog. The retention WINDOW is
# config.failed_retention_days, auto-retry is gated by the auto_retry_failed
# policy, and the stuck threshold is config.stuck_claim_min; this is just how
# often we check. All of it lives here, in the queue owner, so failed-row
# lifecycle doesn't depend on the archiver loop being alive. The watchdog used
# to run only at startup,
# which left a row wedged in 'sending' (e.g. by a manual `queue cancel` race)
# stranded until the next dispatcher restart — self-healing should not require
# a restart. Safe mid-loop: the drain is serial, so at the top of an iteration
# this process has nothing in flight; only genuinely stale claims match.
# Cadence: both queries are trivial (indexed UPDATE/DELETE on a local SQLite),
# so checking every 15 min costs nothing and caps the worst-case time a
# wedged row waits for rescue at minutes, not the rest of the day (a SIGKILLed
# upload — e.g. launchd restart mid-send — strands exactly one such row).

# would churn the queue at full speed, burning each item's retry budget and
# marking thousands 'failed' during what is really a transient outage. So we
# count CONSECUTIVE systemic failures (network/stall/unknown — NOT item-specific
# ones like MediaEmptyError or a missing file, which say nothing about Telegram's
# health) and, once the threshold trips, pause the whole drain for a cooldown
# instead of hammering. Any single success resets the count. This mirrors the
# archiver's per-platform circuit breaker (core.store.bump_circuit_fail), kept
# in-memory here because the dispatcher's fault domain is the one shared session,
# not per-platform. Tuned conservative: a real backlog never sees 8 genuine
# systemic failures back-to-back, but an outage trips within seconds.

         re-queuing one would only waste the send retry budget claiming a
         vanished path. Always runs, regardless of policy.
      2. retention backstop: drop present-file rows still failing after the

         the auto-retry re-queue on purpose: a row failing past the window is
         permanent, so it must be retired rather than re-armed. If auto-retry
         ran first it would move EVERY failed row to pending, leaving this sweep
         nothing to act on — the cap would silently never fire, and a poison row
         would cycle pending→failed→pending forever (the retry storm this
         backstop exists to prevent).

         server-side causes that recover unattended. Storm-SAFE because the
         poison rows (media rejected, oversized, unroutable) that make a blanket

      4. re-queue the REMAINING (recent, present-file) failed rows — including
         permanent ones — ONLY when auto_retry_failed is opted in. Delete-first +
         prune-first mean only present, within-window rows are re-armed.
