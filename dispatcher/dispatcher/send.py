───────────────
The send Strategy. SendStrategy ABC defines the contract; TelethonSend-
Strategy implements it using Telethon.

WHY STRATEGY:
  Today: Telethon (MTProto user-account uploads, native albums). The per-file
  upload ceiling is the account's MTProto limit (4GB on Premium); files over it
  are split into <=1GB parts up-front at ingest (core.media_prep), so the send
  path never has to chunk a file itself.
  Tomorrow: maybe Bot API for some channels, maybe a fake strategy in
  tests, maybe MTProxy in a different region. The drain loop should not
  care which one is mounted — it just calls .send().

ALBUM BATCHING is NOT in slice 1.
  The archiver's _upload_album_bucket logic batches up to 10 files into
  one Telegram album. In the dispatcher world, every row is a single
  send — albums would require either:
    (a) reading multiple rows at once and committing them atomically, or
    (b) a separate "album_id" column to group rows.
  Both are real features but they break the simple claim-one-send-one
  loop. Slice 1 ships single-file sends; album batching is a sub-slice
  for later.

FLOODWAIT semantics:
  Telethon raises FloodWaitError with .seconds. We treat any value
  > max_flood_wait_s as "give up this attempt, requeue without burning
  retry budget" — long flood waits indicate a more serious rate-limit
  problem that benefits from operator awareness. The drain loop can
  surface this via logs and status.

STALL WATCHDOG:
  A half-open TCP connection (sleep/wake, VPN exit dying, NAT timeout)
  makes Telethon's upload await forever WITHOUT raising — retries only
  fire on exceptions, so the serial drain loop would freeze for good
  (observed: a whole night of zero uploads with one row wedged in
  'sending'). Every send attempt therefore runs under asyncio.wait_for
  with a size-aware deadline: stall_base_timeout_s of fixed grace plus
  payload_bytes / stall_min_rate_kib_s. A slow-but-moving link easily
  beats the assumed floor rate; only a genuine stall hits the deadline.
  Timeout counts as a normal network attempt, and the client is force-
  reconnected first — retrying on the same wedged socket cannot succeed.

ERROR shape:
  SendResult.ok=False with flood_wait_s set → "wait then requeue, no
                                              attempt counted"
  SendResult.ok=False with error set       → "failed; count this attempt"
  SendResult.ok=True                       → done

      ok=False, error="..."    -> real failure; count an attempt

    image_process_failed flags the specific case where Telegram rejected the
    file(s) during photo processing (IMAGE_PROCESS_FAILED). It's deterministic,
    so the retry envelope returns immediately and the caller normalizes the
    image(s) with image_fix before a single re-send rather than burning retries.

    media_empty flags MediaEmptyError — Telegram rejected the uploaded media for
    this destination. Retrying the identical send within the budget is futile and,
    at the head of the queue, blocks everything behind it (a single poison album
    starves the whole drain). So the envelope returns immediately and the caller
    QUARANTINES the batch (terminal 'failed', one hit) to keep the queue moving.
    It is frequently transient (a server-side hiccup for that chat), so quarantined
    rows stay recoverable via `archiver reset failed` once the condition clears —
    no bytes or files are given up.

        the native list send didn't carry per-item thumbs/filenames either, and
        UploadMedia re-derives geometry AND a poster server-side (so VP9 renders
        correctly without hachoir leaning on us). Geometry is thus double-safe;
        the on-disk filename shows, exactly as the native path behaved.

        INTEGRITY CONTRACT. The whole sequence runs inside _send_with_retries so
        a MediaEmptyError raised at EITHER new call site — the per-item
        UploadMedia or the group SendMultiMedia — maps to SendResult.media_empty,
        exactly as the native send_file does today. The drain then runs its
        per-item recover_media_empty (re-encode + single send) untouched. Same
        for FloodWait, the stall watchdog, and a dead session. Items upload one
        at a time (each fanned across the connections) — never N×connections at
        once, which the home DC would throttle. A retry re-uploads from scratch
        (fresh file_ids): correct, if not free — efficiency is the lowest build
