## 0. Verdict

**Difficulty: Medium.** The suite is POSIX-bound in **exactly four mechanisms**,
all concentrated in the `core` + `recorder` packages. The DB spine (SQLite WAL),
the media pipeline (ffmpeg/yt-dlp/gallery-dl subprocesses), and the Telegram path
(Telethon/FastTelethon/hachoir) are **already cross-platform**. Estimated effort:
**2–4 focused days** for a working port; the recorder's daemon/process-group
logic is the only part needing real redesign rather than an adapter swap.

The guiding rule: **do not scatter `if os.name == "nt"` across the codebase.**
Introduce one platform-adapter package and route the four POSIX seams through it,
leaving `store` / `ingest` / `send` / `media_prep` platform-blind.

---

## 1. The four POSIX blockers (verified locations)

| # | Mechanism | Why it breaks on Windows | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`fcntl.flock`** file locking | `fcntl` module absent on Windows | `core/core/instance_lock.py:24,75,79,88,107`; sibling locks in `dispatcher/`, `recorder/recorder/lock.py` |
| 2 | **`os.killpg` / `os.getpgid` / `start_new_session`** process-group kill | No POSIX process groups; orphans child ffmpeg → data loss | `recorder/recorder/capture.py:171,177,191` |
| 3 | **`os.fork` / `os.setsid`** daemonize | Neither exists on Windows | `recorder/recorder/cli.py:149,151,152` |
| 4 | **`signal.SIGTERM`** shutdown | `SIGTERM` not deliverable; `signal.signal(SIGTERM,…)` raises | `dispatcher/dispatcher/cli.py:99`; `recorder/recorder/cli.py:136,137,216,217,243`; `archiver/archiver/cli.py` uses only SIGINT (OK) |

Plus one **path** concern (not a hard crash, but wrong behavior):
- Hardcoded `~/.config/archiver-suite/…` and `~/.recorder/pid` resolve to the
  wrong place on Windows. Must route through `platformdirs`.

Everything else (`os.replace` atomic writes, `os.kill(pid, 0)` liveness probe —
which *does* work on Windows, `pathlib`) is portable.

---

## 2. Strategy: one seam, four adapters

Add a new package `core/core/platform/` exporting four adapters, each with a
POSIX and a Windows implementation selected at import time by `os.name`:

```
core/core/platform/
  __init__.py        # selects impl by os.name; exports the 4 adapter APIs
  paths.py           # config_root / state_dir / locks_dir  (platformdirs)
  filelock.py        # acquire_exclusive / probe_shared / release
  procgroup.py       # spawn_group / signal_group / kill_group
  service.py         # install / start / stop / status  (launchd | Task Sched)
```

New dependencies: `platformdirs` (all platforms), `pywin32` (Windows-only,
`sys_platform == 'win32'` marker in each `pyproject.toml`).

---

## 3. Phased execution

### Phase 0 — Hygiene (low risk, do first)
- [ ] Delete checked-in `build/` trees (`core/build`, `dispatcher/build`,
      `recorder/build`, `archiver/build`, `ops/build`, `librarian/build`) — stale
      source duplicates that double every grep and hide edits. Add `**/build/` to
      `.gitignore`.
- [ ] Confirm `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `yt-dlp`, `gallery-dl` resolve on Windows
      PATH (all already discovered via PATH — no hardcoded prefixes exist).
- [ ] Establish a Windows test box / VM with Python 3.12+ matching the pins in
      `requirements.txt`.

### Phase 1 — Path centralization (blocks everything) ✅ DONE (2026-07-06)
- [x] Added `core/core/platform/` package (`__init__.py` + `paths.py`) exposing
      `config_dir(app)`, `locks_dir()`, and app constants `SUITE/DISPATCHER/
      ARCHIVER/RECORDER`.
- [x] **Deviation from original plan:** did **NOT** use `platformdirs`. Its macOS
      default resolves to `~/Library/Application Support/<app>`, which would
      silently relocate existing macOS installs off the suite's `~/.config`
      convention. Instead: POSIX branch = `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`~/.config` (byte-for-
      byte unchanged); Windows branch = `%APPDATA%` (or `~/AppData/Roaming`). No
      new dependency needed.
- [x] Routed every code literal through it: `core/paths.py`, `core/schema.py`
      (new `default_db_path()`, exported from `core`), `core/policy_store.py`,
      `core/migrate.py`, `core/instance_lock.py` (dir only — mechanism is Phase 2),
      `dispatcher/config.py` (.env, session, banned-words, db default),
      `dispatcher/instance_lock.py` (dir only), `archiver/config.py`,
      `archiver/reconcile.py`, `archiver/cli.py`, `recorder/config.py`
      (.env, config.toml, tiktok.lock). `sanitize.py` needed no change (expands a
      passed-in path). `~/.recorder` + `~/recorder-output` left as-is (`~`
      expands correctly on Windows).
- [x] `ARCHIVER_DB` env override preserved (wins in `schema.db_path()`).
- **Verified:** POSIX paths unchanged (smoke test); Windows branch selects
      `%APPDATA%`; all packages import; `core` instance-lock + safebrake selftests
      pass (55 checks). Full `test_seams.py` deferred to a box with `pytest`
      installed / the Windows test pass.

### Phase 2 — Instance lock + liveness (load-bearing) ✅ DONE (2026-07-06)
- [x] `platform/filelock.py`: POSIX = `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX/SH|LOCK_NB)`/`LOCK_UN`;
      Windows = `msvcrt.locking(fd, LK_NBLCK, 1)` on byte 0. Both give **kernel
      auto-release on crash/kill**. API is non-blocking `try_acquire_exclusive`/
      `try_acquire_shared`/`release` over an open file handle. (Windows has no
      shared mode → shared degrades to a non-blocking exclusive attempt, which is
      exactly what the diagnostic holder-pid probe needs.)
- [x] `platform/process.py`: portable `pid_alive(pid)`. **Critical Windows
      finding:** `os.kill(pid, 0)` on Windows routes to TerminateProcess and would
      *kill* the process it means to probe. Windows impl uses `OpenProcess` +
      `GetExitCodeProcess` via ctypes (no pywin32). `core.heartbeat.pid_alive`
      (the suite's one liveness primitive) now delegates here.
- [x] **Wider scope than planned** — the `fcntl` surface was 2 sites, not 1:
      - `core/instance_lock.py` (the InstanceLock; dispatcher's session lock
        subclasses it, so it's covered for free — it never had its own `fcntl`).
      - `core/media_prep.py` `_prep_lock` (the per-file prep flock) — also routed.
      - `recorder/lock.py` needed **no** change: it's a *soft* presence lock
        (heartbeat + liveness), never used `fcntl`.
      - `os.kill(pid,0)` liveness fixed at `heartbeat.py` + `recorder/cli.py`
        (status) + `tests/test_seams.py` (`_dead_pid` helper).
- [x] Holder-pid probe now short-circuits on a missing lock file (never creates
      it just to probe) and opens `a+` so the probe handle is lockable on Windows.
- [x] **No PID-file fallback** — the kernel-auto-release guarantee is preserved
      on both platforms.
- **Verified (POSIX):** instance-lock selftest (acquire / refuse-2nd / holder-pid
      / re-acquire-after-exit) + media_prep selftest pass (80 checks); all packages
      import. **Windows kill-frees-lock test deferred to the Windows box.**

### Phase 3 — Recorder process-group kill (data-loss guard) ✅ DONE (2026-07-06)
- [x] `platform/procgroup.py` with `popen_kwargs()` / `terminate(proc)` /
      `kill(proc)`:
      - POSIX = `start_new_session=True` spawn; `terminate`→SIGTERM, `kill`→SIGKILL
        to the group via `killpg(getpgid(pid), …)`.
      - Windows = `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` spawn; `terminate`→`CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`
        to the group (lets ffmpeg flush and close the file), `kill`→
        `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` (`/T` = whole descendant tree ⇒ the child
        ffmpeg cannot survive). Chose taskkill /T over a Job Object: simpler, no
        long-lived job handle to babysit, and it satisfies the same invariant.
- [x] Routed `capture.py`: spawn now uses `**procgroup.popen_kwargs()`; the old
      `_signal_group` method (with its `hasattr(os,"killpg")` bare-pid fallback,
      which would orphan ffmpeg on Windows) is **deleted** — `_terminate` calls
      the adapter, falling back to the bare pid only when the group is already
      gone. `import os`/`import signal` dropped from `capture.py`.
- [x] Confirmed capture.py is the ONLY production process-group site (remux /
      ffmpeg use synchronous `subprocess.run`).
- **Verified (POSIX):** capture selftest incl. "terminate kills the whole group —
      NO orphan, child stops writing" passes (10 checks); all recorder modules
      import; `popen_kwargs()` returns the right flag. The `_selftest_capture.py`
      group test is POSIX-only (`sh -c`); the **Windows kill → no stray ffmpeg.exe
      in Task Manager** test is deferred to the Windows box.

### Phase 4 — Signals & shutdown
- [ ] Guard `SIGTERM` registration to POSIX. On Windows register `SIGINT` +
      `CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT` (or the service stop handler) → same `stop_event` →
      clean drain exit.
- [ ] `recorder/cli.py` stop command (`os.kill(pid, SIGTERM)`) → send
      `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`/`taskkill` via the procgroup adapter on Windows.

### Phase 5 — Daemonize + service management
- [ ] **Delete** `_daemonize()` (recorder double-fork). Make `--daemon` a no-op
      that points at the service manager (its own comment already says the
      service manager is the real backgrounding mechanism).
- [ ] `platform/service.py` replacing launchd (`ops/launchd/*.plist`,
      `launchctl` wiring). Recommended: **Task Scheduler** (run-at-startup +
      restart-on-failure, simplest) or **Windows Service** via `pywin32`
      `win32serviceutil` (survives logoff), or **NSSM** (wrap CLIs, zero code).
- [ ] Update `ops/ops/health.py` + `ops/ops/cli.py` to query the chosen
      mechanism instead of `launchctl list`. Also review `ops/ops/logrotate.py`
      — its copy-truncate exists because launchd can't be signalled to reopen;
      revisit under the Windows service model.

---

## 4. Already portable — do NOT touch
- **SQLite WAL + single-file coordination** — identical on Windows. This is
  *why* the port is tractable.
- **Atomic writes** (`os.replace` + tmp + fsync in `heartbeat.py`,
  `policy_store.py`, sorter). `os.replace` is atomic on Windows too.
  ⚠️ **Caveat:** Windows cannot replace/delete a file with an **open handle** —
  audit that nothing holds the target open across the replace.
- **`os.kill(pid, 0)`** liveness probe (`heartbeat.py:43`, test_seams) — works
  on Windows.
- **Telethon / FastTelethon / hachoir / media_prep / ffmpeg subprocesses** —
  cross-platform.

---

## 5. Test order on Windows
1. `core` selftests (DB, paths, policy_store, media_prep) — needs ffmpeg on PATH.
2. `filelock` two-instance race + kill-frees-lock.
3. Recorder capture + kill → no orphan ffmpeg.
4. Full seam suite `tests/test_seams.py` with
   `PYTHONPATH=core;archiver;recorder;dispatcher;ops` (Windows uses `;`).
5. Service install + reboot survival + restart-on-crash.

## 6. Definition of done
- No `fcntl`, `os.fork`, `os.setsid`, `os.killpg`, or bare `SIGTERM` reachable on
  the Windows code path (`grep` clean under `if os.name == 'nt'`).
- All config under `%APPDATA%\archiver-suite`.
- Kill-tests leave no orphan ffmpeg and no stale locks.
- Workers auto-start on boot and restart on crash via the service manager.
- `test_seams.py` green on Windows.

---

## 7. Open decisions (need a call before/at Phase 5)
- **Service mechanism**: Task Scheduler vs Windows Service vs NSSM.
- **Port in place vs. fork the tree**: this folder can either hold the adapter
  package as a staging area, or the work lands directly in `../Archiver suite`
  behind `os.name` guards (recommended — keeps one codebase, no drift).
- **Distribution**: ship as pipx installs (as today) or bundle a PyInstaller
  `.exe` per binary for non-technical Windows users.
