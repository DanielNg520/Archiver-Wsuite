core.store
──────────
The one data-access layer. Every process goes through ItemStore; nobody
writes raw SQL against the suite DB. This is where the status state
machine lives (see core.models), so the legal transitions are enforced
in exactly one place instead of being re-implemented per package.

Replaces, in a single class:
  - archiver.db.ArchiveDB  (media CRUD, checkpoints, circuit, stats)
  - dispatcher.db.QueueDB  (claim/mark/requeue/watchdog)
and deletes outright:
  - archiver.dispatch_client.DispatchClient  (no cross-DB handoff exists)
  - archiver.db.reconcile_dispatch_outcomes  (no second DB to reconcile)

CONCURRENCY:
  Claim uses the compare-and-swap pattern SQLite forces on us (no row
  locks): SELECT a candidate id, then UPDATE ... WHERE id=? AND
  status='pending'. If a racing claimer already flipped it, our UPDATE
  matches 0 rows and we try the next candidate. Serial drain makes
  contention nil today, but the watchdog + a future parallel drain both
  rely on this being correct.

# SEND-ORDER CLUSTERING. The queue drains by (priority, discovered_at), which
# alone scatters a user's media: files downloaded in a later run get a later
# discovered_at, so another user who started in between sorts ahead of them and
# the first user's uploads end up split across the timeline. We instead order by
# the *cluster's anchor* — the FIRST-APPEARANCE time per (platform, username),
# i.e. MIN(discovered_at) over ALL that user's rows — so a user's whole block
# stays contiguous, positioned where that user first entered the queue, and
# files enqueued for them later join that block instead of going to the tail.
#
# First-appearance (not "oldest pending") is deliberate: a per-pending anchor
# shifts as items drain, so once a user's earliest items are sent their later
# items would lose their place and interleave again. Anchoring on the stable
# first-appearance keeps singles and >ALBUM_MAX runs contiguous across claims.
# It's a correlated MIN over (platform, username) — cheap via idx_items_user_disc.
#
# cl_prio keeps priority authoritative at cluster granularity (a higher-priority
# recorder/orphaned cluster still drains first); within a cluster rows keep
# (priority, discovered_at) order. Album membership is unchanged — this only
# decides which anchor is claimed next, never what gathers into the album.

        The anchor is the head of the earliest-anchored (platform, username)
        cluster in send order (see _CLUSTER_ORDER) — so a user's media drains
        contiguously instead of interleaving with other users'. The album is
        then everything sharing the anchor's (platform, username, source,
        group_key/caption, media-bucket):

          - source in the key  → an album is never mixed across producers.
          - media-bucket in the key → photos batch with photos, videos with
            videos. The 'single' bucket (gifs/other) yields just the anchor.

        BATCH-IDENTITY: grouping keys on COALESCE(group_key, caption, '') so a
        producer's explicit group_key (orphaned subfolders) beats the displayed
        caption text. When neither is set, falls back to caption (unchanged for
        existing producers).

        MINIMUM-BATCH GATE (optional): when `min_batch` is given, a group whose
        in-bucket pending count is below min_batch(anchor) is DEFERRED — we scan
        past it to the next eligible group and leave it pending to accumulate.
        `flush_age_s(anchor)` is the escape hatch: a deferred group is claimed
        anyway once its oldest item has waited that many seconds. 'single' items
        bypass the gate. When neither callable is passed, the original cheap
        LIMIT-1 path runs unchanged.

        All claimed rows flip pending→sending in ONE transaction (BEGIN
