core.media_prep
───────────────
Make a loose (orphaned / chat_id-folder) media file ready for Telegram BEFORE
it is enqueued. Two concerns, applied only to video:

  1. FORMAT — Telegram streams a video inline only when it is an mp4/mov
     container carrying h264 video and aac/mp3 audio. Anything else (mkv, avi,
     ts, wmv, flv, HEVC/VP9/AV1, …) either uploads as a non-previewable
     document or is refused outright. We normalize it:
       • lossless REMUX when the codecs are already fine but the container
         isn't (ffmpeg -c copy + faststart) — zero quality loss; or
       • a high-quality RE-ENCODE (libx264 CRF 18 + aac) when the codecs
         themselves aren't streamable. Visually lossless, the necessary cost
         of an incompatible codec.

  2. SIZE — a single Telegram upload is capped (4 GiB on a Premium account).
     A file over the ceiling is split into <=1 GiB chunks by the AutoSplitter
     project (lossless stream-copy segmenting with its own integrity check),
     and each verified chunk is enqueued as its own message. A caller may pass
     prepare(split_threshold_bytes=N) to LOWER that trigger below the ~3.9 GiB
     ceiling — e.g. the recorder-output "split mode" cuts every recording over
     2 GiB into <=2 GiB parts (see archiver.reconcile).

ORDER: convert FIRST, then split. Re-encoding an incompatible file often drops
it under the ceiling on its own (no split needed), and splitting on the final
streamable bytes gives correct chunk sizes. When both apply, the intermediate
converted file is split and then discarded.

ROBUSTNESS CONTRACT: this module never raises for an expected problem. A probe
that fails, an ffmpeg error, a missing AutoSplitter, or a failed integrity
check all return a PrepResult with ok=False and the original left untouched —
the caller quarantines the file (so it is not retried every sweep) rather than
shipping something broken or oversized. A file we don't need to touch
(compatible + within size) is returned as a no-op passthrough.

OUTPUT PLACEMENT: derived files are written NEXT TO the source so the orphaned
ingester's subfolder→album routing keeps working unchanged. Split parts are
the exception — the .individual flag marks them as the chunks of ONE oversize
video; the caller (orphaned/reconcile) stamps every part with a shared
split_group_key so the dispatcher ships them as a single ordered album.

    record folder, and a large HEVC re-encode takes far longer than the 180s
    sweep interval — so without serialization the next sweep (in either worker)
    launches a SECOND ffmpeg on the same source, writing the SAME deterministic
    '<stem>.mp4'/'.tgprep.mp4' output. They clobber each other, neither ever
    produces an acceptable file, the source is never registered, and the loop
    repeats forever at 2×CPU. The per-worker InstanceLock can't help: recorder
    and archiver are DIFFERENT named singletons. The contended resource is the
    FILE, so the lock is keyed on the file.

    flock (not a PID file) so the kernel frees it if the holder crashes/SIGKILLs —
    no stale-lock wedge. Non-blocking: a busy file is skipped this cycle and
