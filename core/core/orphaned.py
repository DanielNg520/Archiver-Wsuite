core.orphaned
─────────────
Ingest "loose" files that belong to no platform. The user drops them into
top-level folders under output_dir whose NAME is the Telegram chat_id they
should be sent to:

    output_dir/<chat_id>/<subpath…>/<file>

The folder name IS the routing authority — no env var, no config lookup. Each
file becomes a normal pending item (source='orphaned') and flows through the
same dedup, batching, send, and delete paths as everything else.

GROUPING / CAPTION
  - file in a SUBFOLDER  → album per subfolder. group_key='<chat_id>/<sub>',
    no per-file caption; the dispatcher builds 'sub\\nfile1\\nfile2' at send.
  - file DIRECTLY in the chat_id folder → sent INDIVIDUALLY, one message per
    file with its own filename as caption. Forced by a unique batch key
    (group_key=NULL, caption=the filename) so claim_batch never groups two of
    them; the displayed caption is still the stem.

DISCRIMINATOR (the safety-critical bit)
  A top-level folder is a route dir iff its name is NOT a known platform AND
  is a syntactically valid chat_id (core.routing.is_chat_id). A folder whose
  name is neither a known platform nor a chat_id is a PSEUDO-PLATFORM: an
  upload-only source (no downloading) that otherwise behaves like a real
  platform — real identity, global dedup, persistent rows, destination resolved
  from TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_<NAME> (falling back to the global default). It is
  ingested through the `pseudo_ingest` handler the archiver injects (which owns
  reconcile); with no handler the folder is skipped with a warning, never
  guessed at, because a wrong guess uploads private content to the wrong place.
