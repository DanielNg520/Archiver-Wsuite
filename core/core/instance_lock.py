core.instance_lock
──────────────────
Generic single-instance (singleton) advisory lock, generalized from the
dispatcher's proven pattern so EVERY long-running worker enforces one live
process per name: `archiver loop`/`run`/`start` share the "archiver" lock,
`recorder start` holds "recorder". (The dispatcher keeps its own session-keyed
DispatcherInstanceLock — its singleton-ness is per Telegram session, not per
worker name — but the mechanism is identical.)

Why flock, not a PID file: the kernel releases an flock automatically when the
holder exits OR crashes (even SIGKILL / power loss), so there is no stale-lock
problem and no unreliable PID-liveness heuristic. The PID written into the file
is diagnostics only — it tells a human/ops WHICH process holds it.

PLACEMENT: the path resolves to a fixed config dir, never CWD-relative, so a
launchd-started worker (CWD /) and a manually started one (CWD ~) contend for
the SAME file instead of each taking "the" lock on two different paths and both
running — the exact failure mode this guard exists to prevent.
