core.ingest
───────────
The ONE primitive every producer funnels a finished file through to become a
claimable item row. Replaces the scattered "stat → resolve → add_item" snippets
the archiver/recorder open-coded, and is the only path loose/orphaned files have.

TEMPLATE METHOD — register_file runs a fixed skeleton:

    stabilize → hash → dedup-collapse → resolve identity → insert

Each step is a private function so a future producer can override one without
re-deriving the others. The order is the contract:

  1. stabilize FIRST. A half-written file must never get a row — a row makes it
     claimable, and the dispatcher would upload (and then delete) garbage. This
     is the load-bearing guard for loose-file drops, where mid-copy is common.

  2. hash before insert so EVERY row carries content_hash. The dispatcher's
     global-dedup guarantee is only as good as this stamp being universal.

  3. dedup-collapse BEFORE inserting a second row. Global dedup means "these
     exact bytes are removed as if never there": if a row already holds this
     content_hash we keep exactly one physical copy (the better-named one, via
     core.dedup winner rules) and never create a duplicate row. EXCEPTION:
     orphaned (chat_id-folder) drops skip this step entirely — a drop-zone
     "leaves no trace" (its row is deleted after send), so a re-added file must
     always upload again rather than be suppressed against a stale twin.

  4/5. identity + insert only happen for genuinely new content.

ATOMICITY: ingestion runs in a producer's single-process pass, so the
read-then-write on content_hash isn't globally atomic — but the items table's
UNIQUE(file_path) and UNIQUE(platform, identifier) constraints are the backstop
that rejects a racing duplicate, so the worst case is a redundant hash, never a
double row.

    startup sweep share one Telegram-readiness guarantee. A producer that goes
    through here can never enqueue a file Telegram rejects at upload
    (FilePartsInvalid): a non-streamable video is converted, one over the upload
    ceiling (or `split_threshold_bytes`, recorder split mode) is split into
    parts, and EACH output is registered. Images and already-streamable
    in-ceiling files pass straight through (one cheap ffprobe), so the common

    `split_threshold_bytes` lowers the split trigger below the ~3.9 GiB ceiling
    (recorder split mode); None keeps the ceiling. `identifier_for(out)` /
    `caption_for(out)` override identity/caption per output (the recorder's
    recorder_<stem> scheme); a None from caption_for falls back to `caption`.

    calls (the recorder's reconnect-stitched broadcast segments).

    is skipped if any output failed to register, so source bytes are never lost.
