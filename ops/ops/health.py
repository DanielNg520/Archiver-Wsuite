ops.health
──────────
Standalone health check for the three-process system. Imports NOTHING
from dispatcher / recorder / archiver — it only reads their on-disk
artifacts and OS process state. This keeps
ops installable and runnable even if one of the services is broken or
uninstalled.

Liveness source of truth is launchd when a job is managed there. For manual
foreground workers, fall back to the process table. Self-written pid files are
not used for liveness because they go stale on hard kills.
