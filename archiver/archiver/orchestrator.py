archiver.orchestrator
─────────────────────
Template Method that drives an archive cycle. Delegates the variable
steps to Platform strategies.

Skeleton (same for every platform):
  1. Circuit-breaker check (per-platform tripped flag from prior run)
  2. Health check
  3. If unhealthy → attempt_recovery()
  4. For each user:
       a. Reconcile disk → DB (uses identity-resolver + stability check;
          picks up manually-added subfolder content automatically)
       b. Download new media (date-min/dateafter from db.max_sent_upload_date)
       c. (removed) Uploads are handled by the dispatcher — the archiver
          only inserts pending rows during download
       d. Advance last_run_utc and date_floor checkpoints

The CHECKPOINT change vs v1:
  v1 stored only `last_run_utc` and used that as the date filter.
  v2 stores `date_floor = MAX(upload_date WHERE status='sent')` and
  uses THAT as the date filter. This keeps incremental work correct
  under `delete_after_upload=true` and after long gaps between runs.
  last_run_utc is kept as the fallback when there's no completed upload
  yet (first run).
