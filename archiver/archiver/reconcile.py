archiver.reconcile
──────────────────
"Reconcile v2": walk the on-disk archive, register every stable media
file in the DB, and seed the per-extractor archives so the next
download pass doesn't try to re-fetch already-present content.

This replaces the simple `db.reconcile()` of v1 in three ways:

  1. Uses `core.stability.is_stable()` to skip half-written files
     instead of registering them as broken pending uploads.

  2. Uses `core.identity.resolve()` for every file, so:
       - sidecar JSONs (when present) drive the identifier/date/title
       - manual files (no sidecar, no filename pattern) still get a
         stable hash-based identifier and an mtime-based date
       - the same logic runs whether the file was just downloaded or
         dropped in by the user 6 months ago

  3. AFTER inserting DB rows, seeds the per-platform extractor archives
     (gallery-dl sqlite for X/Instagram, yt-dlp txt for TikTok). This
     is the bootstrap step that prevents a 5,000-post account from
     re-walking its entire timeline on first run with a pre-existing
     archive.

Used by:
  - `Archiver._archive_user()` — every normal run (catches new manual files,
    crashed-mid-download orphans, etc.)
  - `cli.cmd_bootstrap` — explicit "I just dropped my whole archive here,
    teach the system about it" operation.

Both call the same function. Bootstrap is just reconcile + log + advance
checkpoint based on the discovered MAX(upload_date).
