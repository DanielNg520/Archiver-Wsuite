recorder.platforms.tiktok_browser
──────────────────────────────────
Headless-browser fallback for resolving the HLS/FLV pull URL of an
AGE-RESTRICTED TikTok live.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
  The normal path (recorder.platforms.tiktok) asks TikTok's webcast API
  `room/info` for the stream URL. For 18+ streams TikTok refuses that
  request unless it carries a browser-generated X-Bogus/a-bogus signature
  plus a live msToken — TikTokLive's free signer won't sign room/info, and
  yt-dlp hits the same wall. The API returns `{"prompts": ""}` with
  status_code 4003110 → TikTokLive raises AgeRestrictedError.

  A logged-in browser succeeds because TikTok's own `webmssdk` JS runs in
  the page and signs the XHR that fetches the pull URL. So we do exactly
  what the browser does: load `@user/live` with the session cookies in a
  real (headless) Chromium, let TikTok's JS make its signed request, and
  sniff the resulting pull URL off the network. That URL is then handed to
  yt-dlp like any other.

COST / SCOPE:
  This is a FALLBACK ONLY — it is slow (spawns Chromium, ~5–15s) and is
  invoked solely when the API path age-gates. Non-restricted streams never
  touch this module. Requires `playwright` + a Chromium build
  (`python -m playwright install chromium`).

ISOLATION:
  Like the rest of recorder.platforms.tiktok, the async lifetime is exactly
  one call inside a throwaway event loop — no state shared with recorder
  threads. The browser is always closed in a finally.
