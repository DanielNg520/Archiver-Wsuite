recorder.state
──────────────
Explicit state machine + producer/consumer uploader thread.

STATES:
  LISTENING — poll the priority list for a live user.
  RECORDING — a capture is running; wait for it to finish.
  HANDOFF   — a recording just ended; re-scan the priority list ONCE
              (someone else, higher or lower priority, may be live now)
              before dropping back to LISTENING.
  STOPPED   — terminal.

PRODUCER/CONSUMER (guide lesson, kept):
  The state machine PRODUCES finished files onto a queue.Queue; a daemon
  uploader thread CONSUMES them and enqueues into the shared items table. This
  decouples "recording" from "enqueuing" so a slow DB write
  can't make us miss the next stream start. queue.Queue is thread-safe by
  construction — no manual locks.

LOCK PLACEMENT (deviates from the guide's literal code):
  The guide wraps the entire run_forever loop in `with self.lock:`, which
  would hold the TikTok download-lock even while merely LISTENING and
  starve the archiver's TikTok backlog the whole time the recorder is up.
  Instead we acquire the lock ONLY around an active recording (enter on
  start, release when the capture ends). Archiver skips TikTok downloads
  exactly when a capture is in flight, and is free to drain TikTok
  backlog while the recorder idles in LISTENING. This matches the design
  intent in §0 ("skip download while recorder runs [a recording]").
