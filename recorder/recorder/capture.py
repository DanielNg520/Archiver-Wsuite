yt-dlp subprocess wrapper for recording one live stream.

FLAG CHOICES (corrected vs the guide — verified against yt-dlp 2026):
  --downloader ffmpeg   TikTok live HLS is NOT supported by yt-dlp's
                        native downloader; ffmpeg is required for live
                        HLS. Without this you get a few seconds then a
                        "Live HLS not supported by native downloader"
                        bail.
  --downloader-args ffmpeg:-reconnect …
                        ffmpeg does the actual live-HLS download and, unlike
                        yt-dlp's own --retries, does NOT reconnect the HTTP
                        transport by default. A socket stall / rotated m3u8 /
                        mid-stream EOF then kills ffmpeg, ends the recording
                        file, and the state machine relaunches into a NEW file —
                        one broadcast becomes many short clips. These reconnect
                        flags keep one ffmpeg process alive across blips so the
                        broadcast stays in a single file.
  --hls-use-mpegts      MPEG-TS container survives mid-stream disconnects
                        (TikTok lives drop often). NOTE: yt-dlp already
                        enables this by default for live, but we set it
                        explicitly so behavior is pinned regardless of
                        yt-dlp default changes.
  --no-part             Write directly to the final filename, no .part
                        rename at the end. We want a usable file even if
                        the recorder is killed mid-stream — the partial
                        TS is still playable/uploadable.
  --retries infinite
  --fragment-retries infinite
                        A live stream that blips shouldn't end the
                        recording. Keep retrying fragments until the
                        stream genuinely ends (yt-dlp then exits 0).

  We deliberately DROP --live-from-start: it's a YouTube DVR-rewind
  feature, has caused live regressions (yt-dlp #15751), and isn't
  meaningful for TikTok where you record from join point forward.

PROCESS CONTROL (guide lesson, kept):
  Never call proc.wait() with no timeout — it's uninterruptible and the
  recorder could never be shut down mid-recording. wait() polls in a loop
  against a threading.Event so the main thread can terminate cleanly.

OUTPUT DISCOVERY:
  yt-dlp's final filename isn't perfectly predictable (extension depends
  on container negotiation). We snapshot the output dir's mtime before
  start and, after the process exits, return files in our run's directory
  newer than that snapshot. Simpler and more robust than parsing yt-dlp
  stdout.
